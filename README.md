## You-Tube-Like

The idea behind that userscript is my incurable forgetfulness.
I always want to support certain YouTuber I've subscribed with the YouTube-Currency *"Likes"*:
For example by running a whole playlist without even watching delivers the "Views" but not those important "Likes"
That's why I wrote a userscript where I can add YouTube-channels to one of two lists.
The ***Like list*** or for those I *"hate"* the ***Dislike list***.

### Usage

**Alt-L** *toggles* adding & removing current channel *to/from* the **Like-list**  

**Shift-Alt-L** *toggles* current channel *to/from* the **DisLike-list**.
